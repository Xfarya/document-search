Because fossil fuels-oil, natural gas, and coal-take so long to form, they are considered nonrenewable. Let's review. Fossil fuels are sources of energy that formed from the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago. Pressure, heat and time allow the organic matter to transform into one of the three major types of fossil fuels, which are coal, oil and natural gas.\",\n",
